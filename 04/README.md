## Largest palindrome product

### Problem 4
Published on 16 November 2001 at 06:00 pm [Server Time]

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made 
from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

The difficulty in this question comes from choosing a strategy for selecting which 3-digit numbers
to multiply when looking for a palindromic number. The easiest possible solution is to calculate all of the
products of all 3-digit numbers (100 to 999, inclusive). This means there are 808,201 products to calculate while
holding a couple of variables to track the largest palindrome found and the terms that generated it.

The way to improve this is to either a) reduce the number of products calculated and/or b) find a better strategy
for choosing terms to multiply, which will make it possible to find the product earlier. For me, I choose the greedy
strategy as these products will compute really fast on most kinds of hardware available today.

Answer: 906609 (913 * 993)
