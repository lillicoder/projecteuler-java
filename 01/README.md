# Project Euler - Problem #1

## Multiples of 3 and 5

### Problem 1
Published on 05 October 2001 at 06:00 pm [Server Time]

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

This problem is fairly simple and can be done with a single for or while loop, just adding any number in the loop
that is evenly divisible by 3 or 5 to a running sum.

Answer: 233168
