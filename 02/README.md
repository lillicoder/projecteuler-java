## Even Fibonacci numbers

### Problem 2
Published on 19 October 2001 at 06:00 pm [Server Time]

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Pretty straightforward. Since computing each step of the Fibonacci sequence requires the previous and second previous
terms, you can simply reuse two variables for term tracking. All that's left after that is looping through the
limit of 4000000 and checking if each new term is even.

Answer: 4613732
